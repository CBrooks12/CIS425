1.1:

int: INT
int -> bool: ARROW(INT,BOOL)
('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'b): ARROW(ARROW(VAR "a", VAR "b"),ARROW(VAR "a", VAR "b"))

1.2:

succ (pred 5): AST_APP (AST_SUCC,AST_APP (AST_PRED,AST_NUM 5))
if 7 then true else 5:  AST_IF (AST_NUM 7,AST_BOOL true,AST_NUM 5)
fn a : int => f a a: AST_FUN ("a",INT,AST_APP (AST_ID "f",AST_APP (AST_ID "a",AST_ID "a")))

2.4: If the input had been type checked, then I would not need to check all cases to see if
the type is valid or not and throw errors accordingly. If it is checked, then I know for a
fact that what I am getting will not throw errors.
